# Team Project
## January 2024 - March 2024

This project took place as part of my CS2815 - Small Enterprise Team Project module.

Myself and 7 others were tasked to create an Assets Repository system. The idea is that users are able to store assets to a database, to then later recall if required.

My focus was on the backend functionality, specifically for Assets - with some modifications made to other areas of the system.

Final Grade: 81/100
